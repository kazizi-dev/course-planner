# Course Planner
A backend server built using Java, Maven, and the Spring framework in order to support a web UI. Students can plan their future classes using this website because they can figure out the previous course offerings and the professors who previously taught the course, so they can time future course offerings. 

### Motivation:
The goal was to create a tool that could support students from different colleges and faculties.


### Attempt 1:
The first version of this web application was using MVC design pattern, but it was still tightly coupled.

### Attempt 2:
Used Spring dependency injection technique along with MVC design pattern to have less dependency; loose coupling.
